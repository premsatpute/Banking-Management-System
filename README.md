### Banking Management System

**Description**: Developed a comprehensive Java application to manage banking operations, including account management, transactions, and user authentication.

**Key Features**:
- **Account Management**: Creation, viewing, and management of bank accounts.
- **Transaction Handling**: Secure deposit and withdrawal operations.
- **User Authentication**: Registration and login mechanisms.

**Java Concepts and Technologies Used**:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Structured with classes (`AccountManager`, `Accounts`, `BankingApp`, `User`).
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Used for secure database interactions and executing SQL queries.
- **Exception Handling**: Ensured robust error management.
- **Collections Framework**: Utilized `ArrayList` and `HashMap` for data management.
- **Standard I/O**: Interacted with users through the console using `Scanner`.

This project demonstrates proficiency in core Java concepts, JDBC, and secure coding practices.
